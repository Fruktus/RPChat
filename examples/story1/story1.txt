Surrounded by cold water, I opened my eyes. {{td_pause}}

Extending into infinity,{{td_pause: 2}} into horizon,{{td_pause: 2}} endless waters.

Above me, {{ts_glow: yellow; pause}}sun rays{{ts_glow: none}} piercing the surface.

Below me,{{td_pause}} black abyss,{{td_pause}} like a maws of some collosal {{ts_shake: slow}}beast{{ts_shake: none}},{{td_pause}} ready to devour me.

How much time has passed?

10?{{td_pause}} No, 12 hours since crash.

{{cl_shake}} Oh god.

{{ts_type: slow; ts_shake}} The sky... will fall...
