RPChat is a text-based roleplaying app with heavy emphasis on visual effects and overall immersion, with elements from classic rpg games and visual novels.
The app can be used to play (read) standalone stories or as a live messaging app (WIP).
RPChat server is available [here](https://github.com/Fruktus/RPGC-Server), although not yet functional within client.
Built with Godot Engine.

## Installation and running
The project does not require installation.
To open it, simply download the source code and point Godot Engine to the ```RPChat/project.godot``` file.

The latest releases are available [here](https://github.com/Fruktus/RPChat/releases), until v1.0 only Linux and Windows are provided.
